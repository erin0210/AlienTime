# Alien Clock and Earth Clock Comparison

ðŸš€ See project here:
[N2N AlienClock](https://erin0210.github.io/AlienTime/)

This project is a Vue 3 application developed with Vite. It provides a comparison between an Alien clock ðŸ‘½ and an Earth clock ðŸŒŽ.

The application allows users to set alarms and convert times between the two clocks. The Alien clock operates on a different time system, and this application helps to bridge the understanding between the two.

The Alien clock is based on a custom time system, and the Earth clock follows the standard UTC time. Users can input a time in either clock, and the application will convert it to the corresponding time in the other clock.

Alarms can be set in both Earth and Alien time, and the application will alert the user when the alarm time is reached.

This application is an educational tool for understanding time systems and conversions.
